# Taskify App - Technology for Organizationa Purposes

This project can be viewed at [Taskify](https://chivicoko.github.io/taskify/).

## How it works

Basically, this app, named 'Taskify App', gives the user the opportunity to be able to input his days' tasks / activities where he can always refer to it. This acts as a tracking app for one's daily tasks, as one can add, update, or delete a task. One can also mark a task as completed and the task will simultaneously be visibly cancelled; it can also be undone. These tasks can be grouped in the app as I have given them categories through which they can be easily filtered with ease.

## Brief Notes

This app was styled within a css module. Amongst the styling patterns I could have used like styled-components, bootstrap, tailwind css, and others,  I decided to use css module because of things like - no collision of element class or id names accross the app (no conflicts of styles, modularization, helping in making depencies explicit, etc. Overall I saw no reason not to use it.


## Important Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Gets in all the necessary depencies for the app to run successully

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000/taskify](http://localhost:3000/taskify) to view it in your browser.
