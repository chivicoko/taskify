# Taskify App - Technology for Organizationa Purposes

This project can be viewed at [Taskify](https://chivicoko.github.io/taskify/).

## How it works

Basically, this app, named 'Taskify App', gives the user the opportunity to be able to input his days' task/activities where he can always refer to it. This acts as a tracking app for one's daily tasks, as one can add, update, or delete a task. One can also mark a task as completed and the task will simultaneously be visibly cancelled; it also be undone. These tasks can be grouped in the app as I have given them categories through which they can be easily filtered.

## Brief Notes

This app was styled within a css module. I could have used other styling libraries like style-components, bootstrap, tailwind. But, I decided to use the css module, so as to have everything in one file.There also a few styles written inline.

### `npm install`
